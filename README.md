# Drum-Kit
The Drum Kit project is an interactive web application developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to replicate the experience of playing a drum set virtually. It offers both button-based and keyboard-triggered sound playback, providing users with multiple ways to engage and enjoy creating rhythmic beats.
